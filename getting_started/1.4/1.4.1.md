# 1.4.1 systemd \(RedHat7, Ubuntu 15.04+, SLES 12+\)



systemd is a management and configuration platform for Linux. The newest versions of most major Linux distributions have adopted systemd as their default init system.

The Shiny Server installer will automatically install a systemd service called shiny-server, which will cause the `shiny-server` program to be started and stopped automatically when the machine boots up and shuts down. The shiny-server service will also be launched automatically when the installer has successfully installed the program.

To start or stop the server manually, you can use the following commands.

```text
$ sudo systemctl start shiny-server
```

```text
$ sudo systemctl stop shiny-server
```

You can restart the server with:

```text
$ sudo systemctl restart shiny-server
```

This command will shutdown all running Shiny processes, disconnect all open connections, and re-initialize the server.

If you wish to reload the configuration but keep the server and all Shiny processes running without interruption, you can use the systemctl command to send a `SIGHUP` signal:

```text
$ sudo systemctl kill -s HUP --kill-who=main shiny-server
```

This will cause the server to re-initialize, but will not interrupt the current processes or any of the open connections to the server.

You can check the status of the shiny-server service using:

```text
$ sudo systemctl status shiny-server
```

And finally, you can use the `enable`/`disable` commands to control whether Shiny Server should be run automatically at boot time:

```text
$ sudo systemctl enable shiny-server
```

```text
$ sudo systemctl disable shiny-server
```
