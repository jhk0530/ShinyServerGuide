# 2.13.2 R

Defines the path to the R executable that should be used when running Shiny. Systems that have multiple versions of R installed, or do not have R on the path before starting Shiny Server, can use this setting to point to a particular version of R.

Note that, for any `location` with a configured \[`r_path`\] in the configuration file, this environment variable will not take effect. If no environment variable is found, Shiny Server will expect an executable named `R` to be on the path.
