# 2.13.1 SHINY\_LOG\_LEVEL

Defines the verbosity of logging which will be used by Shiny Server. Valid options -- in order of decreasing verbosity -- are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`. More verbose levels of logging \(such as `TRACE`\) may be helpful when debugging an issue or trying to understand exactly what Shiny Server is doing, but will likely be far too much information for a system with even moderate load.

The default if this environment variable is not defined explicitly is `INFO`.
