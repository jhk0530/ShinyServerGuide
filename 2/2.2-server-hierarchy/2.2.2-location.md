# 2.2.2 Location

The `location` setting is defined within a `server` and defines how a particular URL path should be served. For instance, the following settings:

```text
server {
  ...
  # Define the location '/specialApp'
  location /specialApp {
    # Run this location in 'app_dir' mode, which will host a single Shiny
    # Application available at '/srv/shiny-server/myApp'
    app_dir /srv/shiny-server/myApp
  }
  
  # Define the location '/otherApps'
  location /otherApps {
    # Run this location in 'site_dir' mode, which hosts the entire directory
    # tree at '/srv/shiny-server/apps'
    site_dir /srv/shiny-server/apps;
  }
...
}
```

would define two locations, one that serves \(potentially\) a multitude of applications at the URL `/otherApps/`, and another that serves a single application at the URL `/specialApp/`. The various hosting models that can be applied to a location are described in the section on [Hosting Model](https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/#hosting-model)s.

`location` directives can also be nested to provide more granular settings for a particular sub-`location`. For instance, if you used Google Analytics but the Finance department wanted to use its own Google Analytics ID for their `finance` directory, you could accomplish that with a configuration like:

```text
server {
  ...
  # Define the '/depts' location
  location /depts {
    # Host a directory of applications
    site_dir /srv/departmentApps;
    
    # Provide a default/global GAID
    google_analytics_id "UA-12345-1";

    # Define the '/finance' location.
    # Corresponds to the URL '/depts/finance', and the filesystem path 
    # '/srv/departmentApps/finance' as defined by the parent location.
    location /finance {
      # Provide a custom GAID for only this sub-location
      google_analytics_id "UA-54321-9";
    }
  }
...
```

Note that the nested `location`'s path is relative to the parent `location`'s, e.g., /depts/finance in this example. Any directive that can be used for a `location` can be used in a nested `location`, and will override the value specified in the parent, if any. If not overridden, the settings will be inherited by sub-`location`s from their parent `location`s.
