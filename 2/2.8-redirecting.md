# 2.8 Redirecting

The final mode in which a location can operate will redirect to another URL. Such locations will immediately send a response to the client informing them of the URL to which they should redirect, and the status code that should be used when informing the client of the redirection. Typically, a redirect will use the `301` status code for a permanent redirect, or a `302` status code for a temporary redirect. The final option when configuring a location for redirection is whether or not it should use exact matching. If a redirecting location is configured to use exact matching, only requests for that exact URL will be redirected. If not, any requests for that URL path or any subpath of that URL will be redirected. For example,

```text
# Define a location at the base URL of this 'server'
location / {
  # Redirect traffic from '/shinyApp1/' to 'http://server.com' temporarily.
  location /shinyApp1 {
    redirect "http://server.com" 302 true;
  }
}
```

will redirect any requests for the exact path `/shinyApp1` to `http://server.com` temporarily.
