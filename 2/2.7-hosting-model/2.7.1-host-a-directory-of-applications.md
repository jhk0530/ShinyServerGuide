# 2.7.1 Host a Directory of Applications



A location that uses `site_dir` will host an entire directory tree -- both Shiny Apps and static assets. This is the location used to serve an asset or application in `/srv/shiny-server/` in the default configuration file for Shiny Server:

```text
# Define the location '/'
location / {
  site_dir /srv/shiny-server/
}
```

The above configuration instructs Shiny Server to make the `/srv/shiny-server/` directory available at the base URL \(/\). Any Shiny applications stored in this directory \(or its subdirectories\), along with any static assets \(including images, data, JavaScript/CSS files, etc.\), will be made available at the corresponding URL. For example, see the following directory tree:

```text
+---/srv/shiny-server
|   +---shinyApp1
|       +---server.R
|       +---ui.R
|   +---shinyApp2
|       +---server.R
|       +---ui.R
|   +---assets
|       +---style.css
|       +---script.js
```

If this server were available at `http://server.com`, the `location` settings above would make the following publicly available to the user, along with any other file in the tree:

| URL | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| `http://server.com/shinyApp1` | Serve the Shiny App defined in 'shinyApp1' |
| `http://server.com/shinyApp2` | Serve the Shiny App defined in 'shinyApp2' |
| `http://server.com/assets/style.css` | Serve this static CSS file |
| `http://server.com/assets/script.js` | Serve this static JS file |
