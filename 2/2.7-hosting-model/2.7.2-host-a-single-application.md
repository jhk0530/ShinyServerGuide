# 2.7.2 Host a Single Application

A location configured to use `app_dir` will instruct Shiny Server to attempt to serve a single application hosted at the given directory. For instance,

```text
# Define the location '/specialApp'
location /specialApp {
  app_dir /srv/shiny-server/myApp;
}
```

configures the `location` responsible for the path `/specialApp` to use this `app_dir` router, which serves a single application stored in the directory `/srv/shiny-server/myApp`. This configuration assumes a `server.R` file is available at `/srv/shiny-server/myApp/server.R`, along with a corresponding `ui.R` file. If so, the application saved there would be available at the URL `http://server.com/specialApp`.
