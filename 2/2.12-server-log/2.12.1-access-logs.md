# 2.12.1 Access Logs



An access log can be configured globally using the `access_log` parameter. This log is not enabled by default. This setting controls the location of the access log as well as the format used. The access log can be useful to audit the security and activity taking place on your Shiny Server installation. These logs can be audited manually or automatically to inspect how often various resources are being accessed, or by whom they are being accessed \(using the originating IP address\). Currently, one access log is created for the entire Shiny Server process; all Shiny applications share this access log.

The access logs will be written using the [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) logging library; additional details can be found in the "Formats" section of [their documentation](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan#predefined-formats). In brief, there are five pre-defined logging formats for access logs specified in the documentation referenced above:

* `combined` ':remote-addr - - \[:date\] ":method :url HTTP/:http-version" :status :res\[content-length\] ":referrer" ":user-agent"'
* `common` ':remote-addr - - \[:date\] ":method :url HTTP/:http-version" :status :res\[content-length\]'
* `short` ':remote-addr - :method :url HTTP/:http-version :status :res\[content-length\] - :response-time ms'
* `tiny` ':method :url :status :res\[content-length\] - :response-time ms'
* `dev` concise output colored by response status for development use

For example, the following would configure an access log that uses the `tiny` format:

```text
access_log /var/log/shiny-server/access.log tiny;

server {
  ...
```
