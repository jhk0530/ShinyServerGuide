# 2.9 Virtual Hosts

The `server_name` setting allows Shiny Server to route incoming requests to a particular `server` element based on the hostname of the request. This will serve as an additional level of filtering on incoming traffic. Bear in mind that traffic must be destined for this server \(i.e., traffic that was bound for the IP address and port on which this server was listening\) in order to be evaluated for a matching hostname.

For example:

```text
server {
  # Instruct this server to listen on port 80
  listen 80;
  
  # Only accept requests for the hostname 'server1.com'
  server_name server1.com;
  
  # Define the location for this server.
  location / {
    site_dir /srv/shiny-server1;
    log_dir /var/log/shiny-server1;
  }
}

server {
  # Instruct this server to listen on port 80
  listen 80;
  
  # Only accept requests for the hostname 'server2.com'
  server_name server2.com;
  
  # Define the location for this server.
  location / {
    site_dir /srv/shiny-server2;
    log_dir /var/log/shiny-server2;
  }
}
```

This example presupposes that, on this network, the domains `server1.com` and `server2.com` both resolve to the same IP address. In the configuration above, we first create a server that listens on port `80` and will only accept traffic whose hostname matches `server1.com`. We then configure a second server that also listens on port `80`, and require that it only accept traffic whose hostname equals `server2.com`.

This configuration would allow an application stored in `/srv/shiny-server1/shinyApp` to be accessible at `http://server1.com/shinyApp` and an application stored in `/srv/shiny-server2/shinyApp` to be accessible at `http://server2.com/shinyApp`.
